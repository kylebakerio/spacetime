# spacetime
a sphere-collision library for a-frame that also calculates speed, stores historical positions, shows tracked movement, and calculates collisions that occured in between frames; in other words, a very lightweight implementation of continuous collision detection ([CCD](https://digitalrune.github.io/DigitalRune-Documentation/html/138fc8fe-c536-40e0-af6b-0fb7e8eb9623.htm)).
